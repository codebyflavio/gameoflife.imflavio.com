# Game of Life

A simple version of the [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) with the stack ES6+JSX, React and Redux.

## TODO
* Drag mouse around the grid to select initial population (instead of single click)
* Stop/Reset the game
* Set velocity between generations
* Styling - Overall and modular (js in css or css modules for example)
* Add custom presets for initial population layout (User would be able to save those locally)
* Add step button to increase generation number
